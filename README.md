# Enhancing Ergonomics Posture Alert System

## Overview
The Enhancing Ergonomics Posture Alert System is designed to monitor user posture during work sessions and provide real-time alerts when poor posture is detected. By using advanced machine learning techniques, this system helps promote healthier ergonomics in the workplace.

## Features
- Real-time posture monitoring using a webcam.
- Alerts for maintaining ergonomic posture through desktop notifications.
- User-friendly graphical interface with visualization of posture data.
- Visualization of posture performance over time with charts.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ergonomics-posture-alert-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ergonomics-posture-alert-system
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the posture alert system, and you will see the webcam feed along with notifications for posture alerts.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's a brief code snippet demonstrating how the posture evaluation works:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

# Initialize MediaPipe for pose detection
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose()

# Start video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Process the frame for posture evaluation
    # Your posture evaluation code here

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and image manipulation.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time pose detection.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms (SVM).
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing posture data.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plyer**: For cross-platform notifications.

## Model Training
To train the SVM model for posture classification, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your dataset of labeled posture images.
2. Use the `train.py` script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved as `model.joblib`.
